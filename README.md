- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PhilosophicalDuck aka Logan Keiper
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computers (obiously), playing basketball and soccer, watching the NBA and Champions Leauge and EPL. My favorite soccer team is Liverpool.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. This includes java, python, sql, algorithms, and so much more.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have won an air guitar contest at a car festival before!
